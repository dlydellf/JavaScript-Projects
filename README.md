# JavaScript-Projects
A new repo to store The Tech Academy's JavaScript coding projects.

This repository will hold the JavaScript projects I've completed as I advance through The Tech Academy's curriculum, beginning with JS fundamentals and progressing to their "Tic-Tac-Toe", "Calculator", "Pizza Menu", and "ToDo App" projects.
